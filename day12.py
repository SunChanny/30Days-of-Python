# 1) Define four functions: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.
# Each function should take two arguments, and they should print
# the result of the arithmetic operation indicated by the function name.
# When orders matters for an operation, the first argument should be treated as the left operand,
# and the second argument should be treated as the right operand. For example, if the user passes in 6 and 2 to subtract,
# the result should be 4, not -4.
# You should also make sure that the user can’t pass in 0 as the second argument for divide.
# If the user provides 0, you should print a warning instead of calculating their division.

# 2) Define a function called print_show_info that has a single parameter.
# The argument passed to it will be a dictionary with some information about a T.V. show. For example:

#  tv_show = {
#     "title": "Breaking Bad",
#     "seasons": 5,
#     "initial_release": 2008
#  }

#  print_show_info(tv_show)

# The print_show_info function should print the information stored in the dictionary, in a nice way. For example:

# Breaking Bad (2008) - 5 seasons

# Remember you must define your function before calling it!

# 3) Below you’ll find a list containing details about multiple TV series.

# series = [
#     {"title": "Breaking Bad", "seasons": 5, "initial_release": 2008},
#     {"title": "Fargo", "seasons": 4, "initial_release": 2014},
#     {"title": "Firefly", "seasons": 1, "initial_release": 2002},
#     {"title": "Rick and Morty", "seasons": 4, "initial_release": 2013},
#     {"title": "True Detective", "seasons": 3, "initial_release": 2014},
#     {"title": "Westworld", "seasons": 3, "initial_release": 2016},
# ]

# Use your function, print_show_info, and a for loop, to iterate over the series list,
# and call your function once for each iteration, passing in each dictionary.
# You should end up with each series printed in the appropriate format.

# 4) Create a function to test if a word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string of characters that are identical whether
# read forwards or backwards. For example, “was it a car or a cat I saw” is a palindrome.

# In the day 7 project, we saw a number of ways to reverse a sequence, and you can use this to verify whether
# a string is the same backwards as it is in its original order. You can also use a slicing approach.
# Once you’ve found whether or not a word is a palindrome, you should print the result to the user.

# Make sure to clean up the argument provided to the function.
# We should be stripping whitespace from both ends of the string, and we should convert it all to the same case,
# just in case we’re dealing with a name, like “Hannah”.
