# 1) Define a exponentiate function that takes in two numbers.
# The first is the base, and the second is the power to raise the base to.
# The function should return the result of this operation.
# Remember we can perform exponentiation using the ** operator.

# 2) Define a process_string function which takes in a string
# and returns a new string which has been converted to lowercase,
# and has had any excess whitespace removed.

# 3) Write a function that takes in a tuple containing information about an actor
# and returns this data as a dictionary. The data should be in the following format:

# ("Tom Hardy", "English", 42)  # name, nationality, age

# You can choose whatever key names you like for the dictionary.

# 4) Write a function that takes in a single number and returns True or False depending on
# whether or not the number is prime. If you need a refresher on
# how to calculate if a number is prime, we show one method in day 8 of the series.
